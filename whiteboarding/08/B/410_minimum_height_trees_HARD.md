# Where do you expect to be in five years?

Should take one minute; minute and a half at most

##### Prompt

Say: "Where do you expect to be in five years?"  

##### Do you hear these things?

- *Identify*: Does the interviewee discuss their competencies based on what you have asked them? Competencies include:
   - Technical Skills (libraries, languages, etc.)
   - Interpersonal Skills  


- *Prove*: Does the interviewee provide a _specific_ example (past experience or hypothetical scenario)  to showcase competencies and/or fit? Is it presented in the form of a story (punchline, beginning, middle, positive end)?


- *Close*: Does the interviewee showcase why the company should hire them and how their skills/experience/values will add value to and align with the team/company? Does the interviewee showcase what they have learned in "Prove" and how they will apply it to the new role?

# 410 - Minimum Height Trees

Given an undirected graph with N vertices and is a tree-like (meaning there are no cycles, no disconnected vertices or disjoined sets).

If a vertex in the given graph is selected as a root node of a tree, there is an associated height. (The height of a tree is defined as the largest number of nodes in the path from the root to a leaf)

Find the values of vertices, where the associated tree’s height would be a minimum height. If there are ties for minimum, height, return all the values.

There are `N` vertices, and vertices have values ranging from `0` to `N-1`

```
Input:   Integer N denoting number of vertices
	     Array of Two-Item Integers representing edges

Output: Array of Integers representing vertices with minimum height

```

# Example
```
Input: N = 4, edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2,3]]
Output: [3] (because vertex 3 at the root has a minimum height of 2)
```

`Height = 3`


![MinHeight2](http://res.cloudinary.com/outco-io/image/upload/v1520906391/MinHeight2.png)

`Height = 3`


![MinHeight3](http://res.cloudinary.com/outco-io/image/upload/v1520906391/MinHeight3.png)

`Height = 3`     


![MinHeight4](http://res.cloudinary.com/outco-io/image/upload/v1520906391/MinHeight4.png)

`Height = 2`

```
Input: N = 6, edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 3], [5, 4]]
Output: [3, 4]

```

![MinHeight5](http://res.cloudinary.com/outco-io/image/upload/v1520906391/MinHeight5.png)

`Height = 3`

# Constraints

```
Time Complexity: O(V+E)
Auxiliary Space Complexity: O(V+E)
```

`V` is the number of vertices

`E` is the number of edges

# Solution

* 1) Create an adjacency list

```

adjacency list matrix representation
{
  0: [3],
  1: [3],
  2: [3],
  3: [0,1,2,4],
  4: [3,5],
  5: [4]
}
```

* 2) Create a list of degrees for each vertex

```
listOfDegrees = [1,1,1,4,2,1]
```

* 3) Locate all the leaves (degrees equals one) and add to a ‘leaves’ list

```
leaves = [0,1,2,5]
```

* 4) For each leaf, reduce the degree of all its neighbors

```
listOfDegrees = [0,0,0,1,1,0]

{
  3: [4],
  4: [3]
}
```
    * If any of its neighbors is now a leaf, add that into a ‘newLeaves’
      collection replace ‘leaves’ with ‘newLeaves’ and repeat until there are
      only 1 or 2 unvisited nodes

```
newLeaves = [3, 4]
{

}
```

* 5) Return the leaves list

```
newLeaves = [3, 4]
```
