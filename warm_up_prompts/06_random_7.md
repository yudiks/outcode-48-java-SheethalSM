# Math - Random Number

#### Prompt

Given a function `foo` that produces random numbers between 1-5 with equal probability, write a function `bar` that generates numbers between 1-7, that uses `foo` internally and **NOT** the built in `random` function.

#### Examples:

```

Input: None
Output: 4

If we were to run this one hundred times, we would expect there to be an almost
even distribution of fourteen 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, and 7s.


You'll have access to a helper method:
foo() => P(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) = 20%

It outputs numbers between 1-5, each with 20% probability.

You DO NOT have to write foo(), it will be given.

```


#### Input:
```
None
```

#### Output
```
integer
```

#### Constraints:

**Time**: `O(1)`

**Space**: `O(1)`

Solve this without using the built in random function.

#### Hints:

How would you solve this if you had the ability to generate random numbers between `1-8` with equal probability (more numbers than necessary)?

How can you create a larger range of numbers with equal probability?
