# Binary Heap - Random Array to Maxheap

#### Prompt: 

Given an array of randomly sorted integers, rearrange the elements so that the
array is a maxheap.

What is the Big O runtime of this algorithm? Please provide your rationale
as well

#### Examples:

```
Example 1:
arr = [3, 6, 4, 2, 7, 5, 1]
return [7, 6, 5, 2, 3, 4, 1]

Example 2:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
return [8, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3, 2]
```

#### Input:
`arr` = `Array of Integers`

#### Output:
`result` = `Array of Integers`

#### Constraints

**Time**: `??`

**Space**: `O(1)`

Where `n` is the length of the `arr` array

Perform the algorithm in place on the input array, and then return this
input array

#### Hints:

Refer back to the Minheap implementation from your homework

When proving the Big O runtime, consider drawing out the binary tree
representation of a maxheap versus the array representation
