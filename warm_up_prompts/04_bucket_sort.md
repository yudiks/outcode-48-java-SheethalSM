# Sorting - Bucket Sort

#### Prompt

Given an unsorted array of numbers which are randomly distributed
across the a range, sort the numbers using bucket sort.

Input:     
- {Array} - floats
- {Float} - minimum of range (inclusive)
- {Float} - maximum of range (exclusive)

Output:    
- {Array}

#### Examples

Input: [0.897, 0.565, 0.656, 0.1234, 0.665, 0.3434], 0.0, 1.0

Output: [0.1234, 0.3434, 0.565, 0.656, 0.665, 0.897]

#### Constraints

Time Complexity: O(Nlog(N))  
Space Complexity: O(N)  

#### Notes

How does the number of buckets we choose affect the runtime
and/or auxiliary space usage of our function?
