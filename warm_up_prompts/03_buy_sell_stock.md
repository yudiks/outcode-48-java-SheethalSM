# Dynamic Programming - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

#### Prompt

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

#### Examples

Input: `[7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]`  
Output: `5`  

Min buying Price = 1   
Max selling Price = 6  
Max Profit = Max selling Price - Min buying Price = 6 - 1  = 5  

Note: 7 - 1 does not count, because buying price MUST come before selling price.

Input: `[7, 6, 4, 3, 1]`   
Output: `0`

In this case, no transaction is done. Max Profit = 0.

#### Constraints

Time Complexity: O(N)  
Space Complexity: O(1)  

#### Hints

Think of how you would solve the [largest subarray sum problem](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/largest-sum-contiguous-subarray/).  
You can use a similar approach here.

Say you start with an array for prices that is only one element long? How do you determine the max profit of that single price? What if we increase the prices array size to 2? to 3?
