# Linked Lists - Probability

#### Prompt

Given the head node of a linked list with integer values, return a random value
from that linked list. Note that you must do this in linear runtime with only a
single pass through the linked list, and also in constant auxiliary space.

#### Examples:

```

Input:

(5) -> (3) -> (22) -> (4) -> (71)

Output:

If we were to run this one hundred times, we would expect there to be an almost
even distribution of twenty 5s, twenty 3s, twenty 22s, twenty 4s, and twenty 71s
returned.
```


#### Input:

```
class ListNode(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = null;
}
```

#### Output
`node.value` = `integer`

#### Constraints:

**Time**: `O(N)`

**Space**: `O(1)`

Only **one** pass is allowed through the linked list

#### Hints:

How would you do this if you didn't have a constant auxiliary space constraint?

How would you do this if you were allowed a second pass through the linked list?

What would the answer be if you had a single-element linked list? Two elements
in your linked list?

#### Extra Credit

Use the ListNode class from your homework/target practice to create the linked
list from above. Can you prove that your solution is evenly random?

#### Solution

```javascript
class ListNode {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

let head = new ListNode(5);
head.next = new ListNode(3);
head.next.next = new ListNode(22);
head.next.next.next = new ListNode(4);
head.next.next.next.next = new ListNode(71);


function randomNodeVal(head) {
  let count = 0;
  let result;
  let current = head;

  while (current !== null) {
    count++;
    if (Math.random() < (1 / count)) {
      result = current.value;
    }
    current = current.next;
  }

  return result;
}

// console.log(randomNodeVal(head));

function proof(head, rounds) {
  let result = {};
  let current = head;
  while (current !== null) {
    result[current.value] = 0;
    current = current.next;
  }

  while (rounds--) {
    let ex = randomNodeVal(head);
    result[ex]++;
  }

  return result;
}

console.log(proof(head, 100));
// each element of linked list should appear a fifth of the time
```
